Welcome to my project scaffold for using 11ty. 

This is very much work in progress toward learning 11ty and getting a setup that helps me get started quickly with building projects where 11ty shines. 

This ships with a few things built out for you to get started with.

1. Our project is scaffolded with a basic file structure to build off of. 
   - `_eleventy` - holds all of our 11ty config files
   - `netlify` - a directory for our netlify serverless functions
